# Code-Katas

this repository contains some code katas I prepare to do on a more or less regular basis with my
colleagues

## Kata ground rules

Katas are more fun to do with other people, but like any good martial artist who does her/his katas, you can
also do them alone

1. Katas should be done in 30-45min
1. Don't rush, take the time to think first about the solution you want to do.
1. Katas should be repeated regularily,<br/>
  If you know exactly how to do it you can make it more interesting,
  can give yourself some additional rules, like programming it in a certain style, or in another language ...
1. Review your results<br/>
  If you practice with others, have one present her/his solution and discuss
  it, discussions should be done in a positive manner as to progress all participants and all judgements should never be started "**This** Solution is ..." or even worse "**You** ..." but should apropriately be started with
  "**I** find this ...". Basically rules like in code reviews in general!<br/>
  If you are alone, close your exes for five minutes or go drink a coffee/tea... and then take a look at your
  own code

My opinion is that good code should not only do the assigned job, but also be very well readable, easy to extend
or change, but you should already know these rules or look up Uncle Bobs Clean Code book ;)

I am starting to do these katas as submodules, so you should check out this with all its katas with

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dominikschopper/code-katas.git
```

## Code Kata I: Anagrams

the anagrams kata see in the [anagrams](./anagram-kata/README.md) submodule

## Code Kata II: FizzBuzz

the traditional fizz-buizz kata see in the [fizz-buzz](./fizz-buzz/README.md) submodule

## Code Kata III: Game of Life

Conways "Game of Life" implemented in a kata. It is still written in german and has the necessary tests, so you can start right away and implement the logic.

See the [Game of Life](./game-of-life/README.md) submodule

... I guess there will be more to come ;)
